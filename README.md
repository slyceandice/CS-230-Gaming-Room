# CS-230-Gaming-Room

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web based version of their current game, Draw it or Lose it (Currently only on Android). The game has multiple players and multiple teams with several rounds.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I feel like I did particularly well with the Recommendation section. I expanded on each question and provided some examples so its easier to understand for everyone.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think the main thing it helps with is having a full thought process, a template, to work off of. I have different points that I adressed that I can check off and have every mini goal connected to the end goal. Its easy to have the end goal point but having those different points makes it easier to focus on the tasks to reach the end goal. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  Maybe the evaluation table could have been done better. I felt like Most things I was adding were redundent but I think that information is important for each cell, so I should have added more in every cell. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I think I pick and suggested the options that keeps the games integrity and player reach as the #1 priority. Basing it on the users needs when designing is just an easy starting point to expand upon. For me coming up with that point is usually the hardest but having that helps me a ton...ends up making something cohesive that both parties like. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I kinda used to normall just go with the flow and have it all jumbled together. I would know what I want in the end but along the way, when I have to stop at different points, I end up making something a mess and not cohesive. Having this documentation and really having the different goal posts helps keep my code cleaner and though process more in line each time I work on a project. I think splitting things up and putting it together overall in the end is what I would like to do for everything similar.
